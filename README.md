# Dart Language Specification and Grammar

Using TeX sources taken from @[dart-lang/sdk/docs/language][], this project
makes available the generated versions of the following [documents](doc):

- **[Dart Language Specification](doc/dartLangSpec.pdf)** PDF
- **Dart language grammar**, automatically extracted from the specification.

The **grammar** is available in

- [markdown](doc/grammar-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.md). This is the most workable format; e.g., non-terminal symbols are _linked_. Here are direct links to some productions:
    - [_libraryDefinition_](doc/grammar-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.md#libraryDefinition)
    - [_partDeclaration_](doc/grammar-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.md#partDeclaration)
    - [_topLevelDefinition_](doc/grammar-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.md#topLevelDefinition)
- Plain [text](doc/grammar-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.txt).
- [PDF](doc/grammar.pdf) (formatting is still work in progress).
